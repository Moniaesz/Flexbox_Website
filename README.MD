## Website for tax advisory company.

Commercial project made for company in Poland. 
Website is done mostly with flex layout and presented in responsive manner.

#### Page content
* Website is One Page due to "business card" character of its content.
* Responsive Web Design is achieved mostly by setting breakpoints and using media queries to change layout.
* In mobile view I used hamburger menu and its animation in Vanilla JS to avoid using jQuery for one simple task.
